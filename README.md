# Car-Model-Lookup-with-LRU-Cache

**SETUP**

This program makes use of Flask to run the application. If you do not have Flask installed already you can do so on your command line by entering the following command:

`pip install flask`

IF YOU HAVE GIT:

Once Flask is installed onto your local machine, create a new folder where you can store the cloned folder of this repository.
Once you created the new folder, right click and then select "Open in Terminal". The terminal will be in the directory with which you opened from.

Next, run the following command in the terminal

`git clone https://github.com/smm2005/Car-Model-Lookup-with-LRU-Cache.git`

This command will create a folder in the directory with the name "Car-Model-Lookup-with-LRU-Cache".

Then run the command

`cd Car-Model-Lookup-with-LRU-Cache`

Once this command runs, you will be in the directory with that name. To compile and execute the web application, run the following command:

`python webapp/app.py`

When this command runs, the following window will appear:

To open the webapp from here, either hover over the link starting with (http:) and then hold the Control key + left click or copy the link and paste into a web browser.

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE GIT:

Install this repository as a zipped folder by clicking on the green "Code" button then pressing "Download ZIP", then extract the contents of the said zip folder with any desired archiver of your choice (I like to use WinRAR).

When you double click on the extracted folder you will see a "webapp" folder, do not worry about this for now.

Right click on space somewhere along the directory and then click "Open in Terminal"

Run the following command in the terminal

`python webapp/app.py`

When this command runs, the following window will appear:

![alt text](img/image.png)

To open the webapp from here, either hover over the link starting with (http:) and then hold the Control key + left click or copy the link and paste into a web browser.
